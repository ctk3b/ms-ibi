This directory contains several tests.
It is advisable, at the minimum, to run the LJ test to make sure the
code works as expected. To run plot.py, downloading and installing msibi_utils
is highly recommended to visualize the results.

LJ : recover known LJ potential
    - This test, as described in the original paper, is recovering a
      known potential to show that the methodology works. The target
      data was derived from LJ fluids at three different states.

PROPANE : optimize pair potentials for a single-site propane model
    - This test, as described in the original 2014 paper, performs further
      optimizations on propane using a coarse-graining 3-1 mapping. The 3-site
      propane is mapped to the single-site propane and the generated data can be
      compared to known LJ potentials from literature [1].
